# simple-web

This repository has source codes for simple web services using Node.js

I followed lecture of https://opentutorials.org/course/3332 (Thanks 생코!)

This repo describes how the nodejs is working when used as WEB server

This is pretty much simple/best way to understand how the web server 'responds' to user's 'request'
